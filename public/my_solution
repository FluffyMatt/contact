Please give a brief overview of how your solution works in this file......



**************************************************************************

First step was to setup a Vagrant machine to run the code I used https://box.scotch.io/
for that and placed the base code provided by ITRM in there.

I placed the CSS in it's own folder as the JS was in there and it makes sense to.

I decided to use semantic UI as this provide a great frontend framework for UI in apps.
I also removed normalize due to using a framework.

Moved JS from the head to the bottom of the body this is better for page speed. I also
removed the script sitting outside the HTML tag.

Added viewport meta tag for responsiveness.

Moved views into a views directory to allow DRY and give some structure.

Move ContactDirectory into controllers folder. Really a model should be used for the data
CRUD functions but as it's JSON this was quicker.

Added namespaces for grouping of classes.

Added construct to ContactDirectory to assigned json data to private vars;

In the main layout added a capture of the URI to dictate which view to load. Using a simple
routing helper i'm able to check if pages exist using a standard rest url structure. If
the page doesn't exist we show the user a 404 page. This helper also handles page titles.

Contact search added to the header bar along with a link to add a new contact.

Adding a new contact move to it's own page for ease of use. Could allow for multiple
contacts to be added.

Contacts places in cards allowing for them to be set as favourites using the star in the
bottom right of the card.

Search had a exact and partial matching system. If an exact match it appears higher in the
array and higher on the page.

ToDo -
Add ability to un-favourite a user
Add ability to edit a user
